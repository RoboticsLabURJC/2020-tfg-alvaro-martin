# From May to September

Hello all!

I have been working in a interface that guides the user of the images predictor.

It allows the user to choose between Live camera or Recorded Vdieo.

  - First option can use the camera of our laptop/pc or a usb webcam attached to
    get predictions in the moment, of a ball going from the left to the right of view.

  - The Recorded Video selection it's about chosing a video file from the local disk
    and analize it.

Currently it needs to be with a green background and a orange ball.

Also the predictions are not working propertly so I need to improve our generated images used to train other Network.
Extrating the values of X,Y axis from the video recordered I have been using to test the current code, the similarity are not exactly the same as modeled/raw values used to train the LSTM model.

Talking with Inma and Jose María we decided that is better to include a new vlue to the model, witch is the nº of the frame itself.
It start with the first frame when the ball enter in the scene and we can get a centroid.
And finish when the ball disapear from the scene.



Changes to this preferences will be add in the next steps.
