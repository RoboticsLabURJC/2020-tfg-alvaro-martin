# From May to September

Hello all!

After these months with no advance, we come back to the project.
First step is to maintein the logbook up to date and add more info, images, tables to it so all my work can be check quickly with the posts and also can be used when in the documentation/redaction of the TFG.

Next steps for coming weeks are:

- Check how to implement a live video camera frame extractor with the code I wrote in python, instead of the proccess that I use now that implies to record the video and them pass it thought the python script. The idea is to get the predictions in live while our camera is recording.
