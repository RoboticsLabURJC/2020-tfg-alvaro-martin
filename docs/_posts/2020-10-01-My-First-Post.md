Hello all!

This is my first post on this logbook, here I will be posting every week the progress on my TFG.

On this month I will be doing the following:
- Read the TFG and TFM of Nuria Oyaga and see how she used Neural Networks with Deep Learning to predict frames with modeled and raw images.
- Read and study the different models used by Nuria in her analisys about RRNN: MLP, CNN, LSMT1, LSMT4, convLSTM.
- Type of prediction: : Linear, Parabolical, Sinusoidal
- Learning about DOF (Degrees of Freedom)
