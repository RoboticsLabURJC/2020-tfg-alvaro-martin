I"<p>Hello all!</p>

<p>On this week I have been using the web version of the Follow Line exercise, it has been fun, I have addapted to the new platform the code that I implemented last year 
on Robotics course. Here is a visual example of my version:</p>

<p>In addition, I’ve also researched about Django framework for python, I have been following
the 3 first tutorials from the official documentation. I’ve learnt the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Request and Responses</li>
  <li>Models and the admin site</li>
  <li>Views and templates</li>
</ul>

<p>So summing up, what I’ve done during this week is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I have been been using JdeRobot framework as an user, and it works really good.</li>
  <li>Addapted my Follow Line code to this version, and tested the dockericed exercise, it works great!</li>
  <li>Researched about Django framework</li>
</ul>
