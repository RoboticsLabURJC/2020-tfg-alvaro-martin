<p>This is my first post on this logbook, here I will be posting every week the progress on my TFG.</p>

<p>On this month I will be doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the TFG and TFM of Nuria Oyaga and see how she used Neural Networks with Deep Learning to predict frames with modeled and raw images.</li>
  <li>Read and study the different models used by Nuria in her analisys about RRNN: MLP, CNN, LSMT1, LSMT4, convLSTM.</li>
  <li>Learning about DOF (Degrees of Freedom): Linear, Parabolical, Sinusoidal</li>
</ul>
