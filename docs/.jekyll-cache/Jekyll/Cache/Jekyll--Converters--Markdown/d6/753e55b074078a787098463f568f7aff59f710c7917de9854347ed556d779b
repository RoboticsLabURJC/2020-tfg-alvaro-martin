I"ç<p>Hello all!</p>

<p>On this week Iâ€™ve worked on having two working brains, one for each car (Host and Guest). Now we are able to run code on both of the cars.</p>

<p>Also, Iâ€™ve added the bird-eye for the Guest car, so now we can see both of the cars on the canvas birds eye map.</p>

<p>The last I got to say is that Iâ€™ve developed a library that allows to calculate the distance between the two cars using an array of checkpoints along the circuit.
Here is a visual example for the final template:</p>

<p>Here is a video demonstration for the WebRTC-prototype exercise:</p>
