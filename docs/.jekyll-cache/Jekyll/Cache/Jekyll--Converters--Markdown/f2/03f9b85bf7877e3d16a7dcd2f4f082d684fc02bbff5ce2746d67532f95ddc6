<p>Hello all!</p>

<p>On this week I have created a new exercise named webRTC-prototype. For this exercise, I haver designed two
 templates (one for the host and the other one for the guest).</p>

<p>On the host side, I’ve addapted my noVNC streaming code in order the host is able to stream it’s Gazebo 
screen to its friend.</p>

<p>For the guest side, the template I’ve designed doesn’t contain any gazebo controls, for this first version 
only the host willl be able to control the exercution of the codes.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve been studying the docker-side code and I’ve found the path for the f1 model that is 
displayed in Gazebo scenario. With this, I cloned the f1 model, and, used blender in order to change
 the car color. The f1_guest is green color and also its script is publishing in other ROS topics starting 
by “F1ROSGuest/”.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the templates for the new exercise:</p>
