# Alvaro Martin TFG -- Deep Neural Networks for video prediction

Space used for the compilation of all the documentation and scripting files used in the development and follow-up of Álvaro Martín's end of degree work on deep neural networks applied to video predictions. 

Using a network that has already be training for improve which model should be use, we are trying to give it a real use, and predict when and where the objects in a camera are going to be in the scene for the next frames.
