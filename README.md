# Audiovisual Engineering Thesis by Álvaro Martín Menacho

### Deep Neural Networks for video prediction

Space used for the compilation of all the documentation and scripting files used in the development and follow-up of Álvaro Martín's end of degree thesis on deep neural networks applied to video predictions. 

Using neural networks of different complexity, we are trying to predict when and where the objects are going to be in a scene recorded by a camera for the futures frames.
